# QOSF-Screening-Cohort-7-Task-3
My submission for QOSF Screening. QSVM is used to classify iris dataset with a quantum kernel proposed from parametric circuits.  
All the work done is shown in Task3.ipynb notebook. The kernel proposed using parametric circuits, shows a 93.33% accuracy on the test data
